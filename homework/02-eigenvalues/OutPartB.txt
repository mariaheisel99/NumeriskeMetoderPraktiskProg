Part B
Hamiltonian and jacobi routine for the s-wave of hydrogen atom
A calculation of the hydrogen has been performed by following investigations:
 ** Convergens have beeen investigated on Dr_convergens.svg and Rmax_convergens.svg for severeal dr and rmax values
 ** Plot of different lowest eigen-functions are performed for different dr and rmax paramerets. The result are shown on Wave.svg. The exponentiel analytical function are also demonstrated.
