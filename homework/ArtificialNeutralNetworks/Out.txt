------- Part A --------
Test of ann.cs are performed with training points for g(x)=Cos(5*x-1)*exp(-x^2)
The minimization of the cost function is performed with quasi-newton minimization
Construting x and y trainingpoitns on the interval of -1 to 1 wiht 20 points. The Network is set up with 6 neurons
