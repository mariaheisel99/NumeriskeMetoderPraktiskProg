 ###### Test of  (open quandrature) adaptive integrator with Clenshawâ€“Curtis variable transformation for some (converging) infitine limit integrals and added error estimation ######
 Test pefromed with some integrals. Comapared with python integration routines with the same tolerance


 # Integrating Exp(-x*x) from -inf to inf
Result: 1.77240327618564  , error: 0.00217136116259951
Called 80
 #### results from python scipy is given as: ####
 result for exp(-x*x) is 1.7724538509067376 and it is called 150. It should be noted that scipy gave 4e-6 error


 # Integrating Exp(x) from -inf to 0
Result: 0.998396771291765  , error: 0.0017207523769629
Called 32
 #### results from python scipy is given as: ####
 result for exp(x) is 0.9999999997018258 and it is called 75. It should be noted that scipy gave 5e-5 error
