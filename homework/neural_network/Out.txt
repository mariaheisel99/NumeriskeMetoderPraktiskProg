------- Part A --------
Test of ann.cs are performed with training points for g(x)=Cos(5*x-1)*exp(-x^2)
The minimization of the cost function is performed with quasi-newton minimization
Construting x and y trainingpoitns on the interval of -1 to 1 wiht 20 points. The Network is set up with 6 neurons

 The results are plotted on TestFunctionPlotA.svg

---------- Part B ----------
Performing ANN on a Gaussian Wavlet f(x)=x*exp(-x^2)
Return also first and second derivatives and the anti-dericative of the approximant to the Gaussain Wavlet
Construting x and y trainingpoitns on the interval of -1 to 1 wiht 20 points. The Network is set up with 5 neurons

 The results are plotted in a muliplot on PlotB.svg
