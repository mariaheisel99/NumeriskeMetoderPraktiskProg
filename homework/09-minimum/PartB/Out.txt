Higgs discovery

The Breit-Wigner function are fitted to higgs data. The fit is performed by minomizing the deviation funcktion. The fit are plotted with experimental data on Higgs.svg
The fit resulted in determine mass and experimental width of the Higgs bosen, the fit result of these parameters are provided on the first line of out.data.txt.
