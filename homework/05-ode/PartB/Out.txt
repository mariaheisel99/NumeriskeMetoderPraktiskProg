Part B is performed where the Driver in ode.cs is improved. This is done such that the driver records the path only if the generic lists for x and y are initialized. If the lists are null the driver only returns y. Also the acceptance are changed.

An example Lotka-Volterra system is reproduced. See LotkaVolterraSystem.svg
